%usage of addpath:
% Add folders specified into the search path of MATLAB
% The search path, or path is a subset of all the folders in the file system. 
% MATLAB® software uses the search path to efficiently locate files used with MathWorks® products. 
% MATLAB can access all files in the folders on the search path.
% The order of folders on the search path is important. When files with the same name 
% appear in multiple folders on the search path, MATLAB uses the one found in the 
% folder nearest to the top of the search path.
